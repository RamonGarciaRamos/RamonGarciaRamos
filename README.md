<h1>Ramon Garcia Ramos Mechanical Engineering Student</h1>

<p>I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Kennesaw State University (graduating May 2026) focused on bridging high-fidelity mechanical design with systems-level execution. My technical background is anchored by seven SolidWorks certifications, including Professional-level credentials in Drawing Tools and Mold Making, alongside proficiency in Siemens NX, ANSYS, and FEA. I specialize in translating complex conceptual architectures into functional, manufacturing-ready products through a combination of traditional engineering principles and modern additive manufacturing.



<h2>My experience spans interdisciplinary project leadership and technical research:</h2>


<b>Aerospace Systems:</b> Served as a Programmatics Mechanical Engineer for a NASA L’SPACE mission concept acadamy, integrating mechanical design with science and programmatic constraints to deliver WBS elements and risk assessments aligned with NASA systems engineering standards.

<b>Autonomous Systems:</b> Designed and prototyped complex assemblies, including an overhead rail-guided drone system and a full-scale pumpkin trebuchet, utilizing statics and dynamics to optimize structural performance.

<b>AI & Research:</b> Assisted in deep learning research for drone-based detection, contributing to dataset annotation and model training for segmentation projects.
I am a "safety-first" engineer who maintains an Active Security Clearance and a disciplined approach to project lifecycles, ensuring all designs meet rigorous quality control and regulatory standards</p>
